# Solutions to Advent Of Code 2023

Posted here for educational purposes, are solutions to Advent of Code 2023. The solutions are
written in Python. Most solutions require Python3.10 or greater to work (the `match` statement
introduced in 3.10 is just too nice to overlook). 

Not all solutions are performant, but some optimization was considered when attempting them.

## Running the code
The code requires that you first set the python path to include the root directory:
```
export PYTHONPATH=.
```

Once that solutions can be run on each day:
```
python3.10 day1
```

By default the solution is run against the test data, and for the Part 2 solution

## Caveats
Some questions required different data between the two parts of the puzzle. In those cases,
 data for part 2 are only included.
